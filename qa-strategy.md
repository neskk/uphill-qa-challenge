# QA Automation Strategy

## 1. Core Testing Principles and Methodologies

### Shift-Left Testing

Testing begins at the story refinement stage, ensuring fast feedback and defect prevention.

- Well-defined user stories and acceptance criteria:
    - Each story must be unambiguous, consistent, feasible, and traceable — forming the baseline for all validation efforts.
    - Clear specifications ensure shared understanding, reduce rework, and allow tests to be defined before code is written (ATDD).

- Cross-functional collaboration during backlog grooming and sprint planning:
    - QA actively participates in story refinement, helping identify edge cases, test scenarios, and automation requirements early.
    - Define priorities, timelines and critical paths for implementing automated tests.

Tools and practices support testing often and early with continuous validation, static analysis, and tight CI integration, embedding quality rather than inspecting it later.

### Test Pyramid Strategy

We want to minimize overlapping tests across the pyramid levels. Each ascending level of the pyramid addresses more complex problems, assuming that basic functionalities and lower-level interactions have already been covered by the preceding test levels.

- Unit Tests: These are fast, isolated tests focused on individual components or functions. They should be mostly owned by developers, with QA providing support in defining expected behavior directly from user stories.
- Integration Tests: These tests ensure proper functionality and data flow on interactions between Up internal and external services.
- End-to-End (E2E) Tests: These tests cover essential user workflows and critical user behaviors. They are written in a business-readable Gherkin language to ensure clear communication and alignment with stakeholder expectations.


### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

- Using Gherkin syntax to describe expected behavior bridges communication across developers, QAs, and stakeholders, ensuring features are built according to expectations the first time.
- Clear, reusable, and well-structured step definitions ensure consistency and abstract implementation details to help focus on core business logic.

### Continuous Feedback Loop

Automated tests run in the CI pipeline to provide fast, consistent feedback on every commit and pull request. This supports early issue detection and allows developers to address problems while changes are still fresh.

- Merge Request CI Pipelines:
    - Run validation tests to enforce company policies and to catch issues early.
    - Execute comprehensive test suites to verify system integrity.
    - Block progress if any of validations is not passing.

### Risk-Based Testing

Testing effort is concentrated on high-impact, high-risk areas—particularly, specially those affecting patient safety and data security.
